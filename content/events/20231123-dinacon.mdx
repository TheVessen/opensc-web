DINAcon â€“ the conference for digital sustainability.

Digital transformation is omnipresent. How can we ensure that the ongoing digitalisation also generates sustainable benefits for our society? One answer to this is offered by the principle of digital sustainability. Digital sustainability describes how digital knowledge goods (data, content, software) must be created and made accessible so that they create the greatest possible benefit for society and the environment.
