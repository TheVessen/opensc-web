Join us for the first ever COMPAS Developer Day! An event tailored for architects, computational designers and engineers eager to delve into the latest innovations within the COMPAS framework and its expanding ecosystem.
 
The COMPAS Core Development team will present the newly released COMPAS 2.0 and demo some of the newly developed extension packages. Additionally, industry guest speakers will share how they have integrated the framework into their projects. We will close with an overview of future developments, followed by an ápero.
