Bauen digital Schweiz / buildingSMART Switzerland, the data Innovation alliance and opensource.construction are holding an open innovation workshop on the topic of “Construction & Data Science”. The workshop brings together top experts from the construction industry and the data science community.

The workshop addresses a current challenge in the construction industry: data quality. Data must be available throughout the entire value chain, i.e. from acquisition, planning and construction to operation, and structured in such a way that added value can be created using current approaches from the fields of data analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence.

The workshop offers participants the opportunity to identify cross-disciplinary projects and develop creative approaches to solutions. To this end, the challenges in the construction industry will first be explained along a typical project flow and an introduction to the stakeholders involved. Participants from the construction industry bring initial ideas that serve as anchor points for discussion in small groups and are further developed across disciplines. The best proposals are selected in a pitch. These are given the opportunity to flesh out the ideas into a project as part of the Innovation Booster Databooster, with the teams receiving methodological and financial support of up to CHF 25,000.
