It’s done!

We are still a bit hyped from the overwhelmingly positive feedback we got 🙏.

What made the event so special was the great mix of people we had on site.
We welcomed around 250 participants and visitors.
From Switzerland and all over Europe to Canada and India.
From users to coders to #opensource solution providers to decision makers.

Many came as first time hackers and many as first time open sourcers.
Many left as keen enthusiasts 💪.

It’s stunning to see what’s possible if a group of motivated individuals from different companies aligns on one goal and truly collaborates on a weekend. The degree of self organisation, the quality of the prototypes and the tools that are available today is nothing else than amazing 🚀.

Everyone who participated in the Hack throughout the weekend can consider himself / herself a #winner. 20 (!) teams presented their work. Four teams got a special recognition from the jury members Edyta Augustynowicz, Philippe Block and Yashar Moradi.

Here are the links to the final presentations:
