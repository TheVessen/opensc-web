The Future of Construction 2023 Symposium provides a platform to discuss novel human-machine collaborations in design and construction. Together we will raise questions about how complementary skills—the accuracy and speed of machines and their ability to crunch large amounts of data, jointly with our capacity as humans to solve problems creatively, flexibly, and collaboratively—can affect the ecologically, economically, and socially sustainable development of the built environment. It will be held in hybrid mode, with participants from academia, start-ups, and the construction industry.

Join us at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.linkedin.com/company/technische-universitat-munchen/) for three days filled with innovative ideas, inspiring speakers, critical discussions, new tech workshops, poster sessions, and amazing networking opportunities.
