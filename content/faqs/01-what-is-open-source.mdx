title: What is open source?
---

Open source has many facets. From technical topics such as Open Code, Open Data, and OpenAPI (open interfaces) to thematic topics such as OpenGLAM (Galleries, Archives, Libraries, and Museums) or OpenGOV (Government Data), the spectrum is wide. What all "open" topics have in common is well summarised in the definition published by the [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://okfn.org/en/):

> Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose - without legal, technical or social restrictions.

This principle sets open solutions apart from proprietary, “closed” solutions. By embracing this principle, companies can collaboratively address fundamental issues that are not directly linked to their core value creation. Open source solutions go beyond that. They establish a foundation for a technological level that individual companies with limited budgets would struggle to achieve on their own.
