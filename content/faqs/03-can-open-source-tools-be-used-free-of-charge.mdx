title: Can open source tools be used free of charge?
---

Open source software does not necessarily imply that software is provided free of charge. However, it does mean that the source code, data structure, or database contents are freely accessible. Around this framework, which is available free of charge, companies can build services, user interfaces, interfaces, etc., which they can charge users for as they see fit. In this context, "free" refers to the rights of everyone to use the tools and not necessarily that a tool developed based on open source principles is available "free of charge" to end users.
