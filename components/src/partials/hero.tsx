            Open source in the construction industry
          </h2>
          <p>
            The construction industry is characterized by numerous small and
            medium-sized companies that operate locally, adhere to existing
            standards, and have limited or no budget for research and
            development â€“ certainly not for the development of digital
            solutions. Consequently, each company attempts to independently
            invent and implement solutions with constrained resources and only
            within their silo. As a result, it becomes challenging to
            effectively address the upcoming challenges related to ambitious
            cost and sustainability goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this situation can serve as an exciting starting point for
            developing user-oriented tools that transcend individual companies,
            adopting an open-source mindset.

              77% of code used in software projects around the world originated
              from open source
            </h3>
            <p>
              Issues like low efficiency and duplication of efforts in
              transformation processes are well known in other domains as well.
              By facilitating open collaboration across companies, the open
              source movement has proven to be a powerful approach to enable
              continuous improvement also with limited resources.
            </p>
            <p>
              The movement has changed the way modern software is created.
              Rather than re-implementing basic features again and again, the
              limited number of developers within an organisation can focus on
              features that are differentiating for the company in the market.
            </p>
            <p>The key arguments to leverage open source are:</p>
            <ul className="list-none pl-0">
              <li>ðŸ‘‰ do more with the same budget</li>
              <li>ðŸ‘‰ reduce maintenance efforts</li>
              <li>ðŸ‘‰ improve continuously</li>
              <li>ðŸ‘‰ attract (and keep) talents </li>
              <li>ðŸ‘‰ innovate faster</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div className="mx-auto lg:w-9/12">
          <h3 className="md:text-2xl">Collaboration as an unfair advantage</h3>
          <p>
            By institutionalising open collaboration across companies with
            concrete output (code), open source has evolved into a movement that
            extends beyond software development. The open source approach
            doesnâ€™t imply that everyone in the construction industry must learn
            programming and become a geek. Quite the opposite, collaborative
            development allows individuals to contribute their unique strengths
            in the most effective manner possible. For some, this may involve
            providing feedback on content while others may contribute in project
            organization, software development or financial support to specific
            projects.
